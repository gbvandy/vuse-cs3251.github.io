## Homework Assignment Grading Rubric

All homework assignments involve C++ programming.  We expect you to be good C++
programmers since all of you should have taken CS2201 (or equivalent). We also
expect you to use tools to help you be better, more productive, programmers.

* Assignments must be submitted using GitHub; you will receive an email for
  every assignment which contains a link that you can follow to create a
  repository to submit the assignment.
* The most recent commit on `master` of the GitHub repository you create prior
  to the assignment deadline will be considered your submission. This means that
  you must both commit to master and push to GitHub prior to the deadline for
  your submission to be considered!
* Late submissions -- even those which are just one second late -- will *not*
  be graded, no exceptions.
* To receive full credit, the Travis build must complete successfully and run
  all associated tests.

Listed below are rules that will govern how your submissions will be graded.

### General Grading Approach

* 40% Execution correctness 
* 30% Structure (e.g., modularization, information hiding) 
* 10% Insightful programming (e.g., developing reusable class components) 
* 10% Consistent style (e.g., capitalization, indenting) 
* 10% Appropriate coding and commenting style, based on the Coding Standard document.

### Standard Deductions

1. -40% for failure to compile (i.e. no errors or warnings) or
   failure to enable Travis builds,
1. -20% for failure to pass all tests; proportional credit will be awarded for
   all successful tests,
1. -10% for failure to conform to style guidelines
1. D
1. E
1. F

Deductions will be applied for each of multiple occurrences of the same error,
up to three occurrences of said error, e.g. if 4% is deducted for each
occurrence of some error, 12% can be deducted for three or more occurrences of
said error.
