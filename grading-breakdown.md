# 3251 Homework Assignment Grading Rubric

All homework assignments involve C++ programming.  We expect you to be good C++ programmers since all of you should have taken CS2201 (or equivalent).
We also expect you to use tools to help you be better, more productive, programmers.  All assignments must be submitted using Github.  You will receive an email with a link to create a repository for each assignment.
You must commit your code to the repository by the assignment deadline.  No late submissions will be grade, period.
Besides just being pushed to Github, all assignments must build succesfully on Travis, and must run all of the associated tests.

Listed below are the rules the graders will follow as they review your submissions.

### General Grading Approach

* 40% Execution correctness 
* 30% Structure (e.g., modularization, information hiding) 
* 10% Insightful programming (e.g., developing reusable class components) 
* 10% Consistent style (e.g., capitalization, indenting) 
* 10% Appropriate coding and commenting style, based on the Coding Standard document.


### Standard Deductions

1. -40pts failure to compile (must have no errors or warnings) or failure to enable Travis
2. -20pts failure to pass all tests.  Proportional credit for number of tests passed.
3. C
4. D
5. E
6. F

Repeated errors of the same type will be deducted up to 3x the nature of the error.  E.g. an error with -4pts that is repeated throughout the code can result in at most -12pts.
